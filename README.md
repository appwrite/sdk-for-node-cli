## Installation

The Appwrite CLI is a Node based command line tool to help you interact with the Appwrite API. The CLI is distributed both as an [`npm package`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/appwrite-cli) as well as [pre built binaries](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-node-cli/releases/latest) for specific operating systems and architectures.

### Install using NPM
---

If you have `npm` installed, it's as easy as running

```sh
$ npm install -g appwrite-cli
```

Once the installation is complete, you can verify the install using

```sh
$ appwrite -v
0.0.19
```

### Install using prebuilt binaries
---

If you do not have `npm` installed, you can always install the prebuilt binaries for your architecture and OS using our convenient installation scripts.

### Linux / MacOS 
```bash
$ wget -q https://appwrite.io/cli/install.sh  -O - | /bin/bash
```

### Windows
```powershell
$ iwr -useb https://appwrite.io/cli/install.ps1 | iex
```

Once the installation completes, you can verify your install using
```
$ appwrite -v
0.0.19
```

To build and test the CLI for development, follow these steps 

1. Clone the SDK Generator repository and cd into the directory
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-generator
$ cd sdk-generator
```

2. Ensure Docker is running locally and then install the composer dependencies using
```sh 
$ docker run --rm --interactive --tty --volume "$(pwd)":/app composer install --ignore-platform-reqs --optimize-autoloader --no-plugins --no-scripts --prefer-dist

# Generate the SDKs
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app php:7.4-cli php example.php
```

3. Head over to the generated SDK and install the dependencies.
```sh
$ cd examples/node-cli
$ npm install 
```

4. Install the CLI using 
```sh
$ npm install -g .
```

5. You can now use the CLI 
```sh
$ appwrite -v
```
